                Adventures don’t have to be dangerous. You don’t have to fear for your life. You don’t have to go shark-diving or sail around the world solo.

Adventure is all about attitude. Trying something new, or trying something differently than before. Getting out of your comfort zone. Willfully choosing to walk an unknown path.
                <br>
                <br>
                Adventure requires a certain amount of bravery. Daring to step into that new restaurant in your hometown where you can’t pronounce the items on the menu. Choosing to take the local form of transportation instead of hiring a car. Booking a spontaneous holiday to a new destination with a new travel companion.
                Adventure is never far away. In your home state. Country. Even your current home town. You can have adventures every day without risking your life, spending away your life savings, or having to fly halfway across the world.

                Biking is a top-notch cardio workout. You’ll burn about 400 calories an hour. Plus it strengthens your lower body, including your legs, hips, and glutes.

If you want a workout that’s gentle on your back, hips, knees, and ankles, this is a great choice.

You can cycle on the road, a bike path, or a mountain trail. Indoors, you can do your workout on a stationary bike or buy a stand, called an indoor trainer, for your outdoor bike.
<br>
<br>

If you’re a beginner, choose a flat bike path or road. If you’re ready for a tougher workout that also engages your upper body and core, try mountain biking. It’s also called off-road biking. You can do it on trails and different types of rough terrain.

Mountain biking is trickier because you have to navigate hills and surfaces, so your upper body and core will kick into gear. It’s more of a total-body workout than biking on the road, which is mostly a lower-body cardio workout.

                Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.The pilot sits in a harness or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

                <br>
                Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height, often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

                Surfing, sport of riding breaking waves towards the shore, particularly by means of a board. Surfing’s roots dwell pre-modern Hawaii and Polynesia, where the game was practiced by both men and women from all social strata from royalty to commoners. Organized competitions helped to counter this negative image and to win surfing some social respectability. Here is everything you need to know about surfing in India.

                India’s 7500 kilometre coastline provides several spots for surfboarding. The largest waves are typically seen between May and September, the pre-monsoon and monsoon season.

Waters of India are already well-liked for hosting a range of adventure sports like rafting, kayaking, sailing, stream crossing, and plenty of others. One such upcoming sport is Surfing in India.

The western coast is great for beginners to get acquainted with a surfboard, whereas eastern shores have stronger currents and harder wave breakpoints.
